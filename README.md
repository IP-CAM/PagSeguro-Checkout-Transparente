#: dollar: Advantages

### Payment made entirely on your e-commerce or website
The customer stays in your e-commerce environment or website during the entire purchase process, without the need for registration or intermediate payment pages.

### Increase your sales conversion
You can have an increase of up to 30% in the conversion of your sales, since the number of steps in your checkout will be reduced and your customers will not be directed to pages external to your e-commerce or website.

### Data security made by PagSeguro
Your customers' payment details are sent directly from the browser to PagSeguro. Without going through your servers, you don't have to worry about the security of this information.
